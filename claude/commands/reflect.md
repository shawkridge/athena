# /reflect

Comprehensive self-assessment of memory system quality, cognitive strategies, learning effectiveness, and confidence levels.

## Usage

```bash
/reflect                 # Quick reflection
/reflect --deep         # Deep introspection (5-10 min)
/reflect --domain AUTH  # Reflect on specific domain
/reflect --gaps         # Focus on knowledge gaps
```

## What It Shows

- **Memory Quality Assessment** - Accuracy, consistency, coverage
- **Learning Effectiveness** - Encoding strategies, retention rates
- **Cognitive Strategies** - What's working, what's not
- **Confidence Calibration** - Over/under-confidence analysis
- **Error Patterns** - Common mistakes, biases
- **Improvement Recommendations** - Next steps for growth

## Example Output

```
DEEP SELF-REFLECTION REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Memory Quality Metrics:
  • Overall Accuracy: 93% (high)
  • False Positive Rate: 3% (low, acceptable)
  • Contradiction Detection: Excellent (91%)
  • Missing Info Detection: Good (78%)

Learning Effectiveness:
  • Encoding Strategy Fitness: 0.87/1.0
    - Best: Episodic event + semantic extraction
    - Weakest: Ad-hoc fact memorization

  • Retention Rate: 0.82/1.0
    - 6-month retention: 84%
    - 1-month retention: 91%

  • Consolidation Quality: 0.88/1.0
    - Compression ratio: 0.82 ✓
    - Pattern extraction: Strong

Cognitive Strategies:
  ✓ Working memory management: Excellent
  ✓ Procedural learning: Very good
  ✓ Association networks: Good
  ⚠ Query transformation: Could improve
  ⚠ Reflection frequency: Low

Confidence Calibration:
  • Overall Calibration: Slightly overconfident (+0.07)
  • Domains:
    - High Confidence (0.95+): JWT, React, Node.js
    - Medium Confidence (0.75-0.95): Database, Testing
    - Low Confidence (<0.75): DevOps, Kubernetes
    - Over-confident: Testing (0.90 actual vs 0.95 stated)
    - Under-confident: Kubernetes (0.68 actual vs 0.50 stated)

Error Patterns Detected:
  1. Temporal confusion - Mixing up when things changed
  2. Attribution errors - Misremembering decision rationale
  3. Hindsight bias - Overestimating obviousness
  4. Recency bias - Recent events weighted too heavily

Top Improvement Opportunities:
  1. Increase reflection frequency (weekly → 2x/week)
  2. Improve query transformation (rewrite 10% of queries)
  3. Calibrate DevOps confidence (needs research)
  4. Document decision rationales (preventing attribution errors)
  5. Balance recency with long-term patterns

Domain Deep Dive: JWT Implementation
  • Expertise Level: Expert (0.95)
  • Completeness: 95% (only missing OAuth2 integration)
  • Currency: Fresh (updated 2h ago)
  • Application Success: 12/12 (100%)
  → Confidence: Justified, high trust

Next Steps:
  1. Run `/memory-health` for gap analysis
  2. Create reminder for weekly reflection
  3. Research DevOps patterns (improve confidence)
  4. Document decision framework for attribution clarity
  5. Implement 2x/week reflection schedule

Last Reflection: 3 days ago
Current State: Healthy, minor calibration issues
Recommendation: Increase reflection frequency
```

## Commands

```bash
/reflect              # Quick assessment
/reflect --deep      # 10-minute deep dive
/reflect --domain AUTH  # Focus on domain
/reflect --gaps      # Knowledge gaps only
/reflect --confidence # Calibration analysis
/reflect --strategies # Learning effectiveness
```

## Integration

Works with:
- `/memory-health` - Detailed gap analysis
- `/consolidate` - Improve learning strategies
- `/memory-query` - Research low-confidence areas
- `/project-status` - Link reflection to work

## Related Tools

- `get_self_reflection` - Core reflection engine
- `get_metacognition_insights` - Comprehensive insights
- `check_cognitive_load` - Capacity assessment
- `evaluate_memory_quality` - Quality metrics
- `get_learning_rates` - Effectiveness analysis

## When to Run

- **Weekly**: Quick reflection (10 min)
- **After major work**: Assess learning from project
- **Monthly**: Deep reflection (1 hour)
- **Quarterly**: Strategic review (1-2 hours)

## Reflection Questions

1. What's my biggest knowledge gap?
2. What strategy works best for me?
3. Am I over/under-confident?
4. What should I focus on next?
5. How effective is my consolidation?

## Tips

1. Be honest about gaps (they're opportunities)
2. Review error patterns (don't repeat)
3. Adjust confidence based on results
4. Share insights with team (if applicable)
5. Update strategies quarterly
