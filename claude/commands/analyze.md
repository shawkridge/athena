# /analyze - Analytics & Patterns

Access Phase 6 analytics features for estimation tracking and pattern discovery.

## Usage
```
/analyze accuracy <project_id>   Check estimation accuracy metrics
/analyze patterns <project_id>   Extract completion patterns
```

## Examples
```
/analyze accuracy 1
/analyze patterns 1
```

## What It Does

### Accuracy Analysis
- Calculates variance between estimated vs actual task duration
- Shows percentage of tasks completed within 20% variance
- Identifies over/under estimation trends
- Tracks improvement over time

### Pattern Discovery
- Identifies task completion rate by priority
- Discovers most common failure reasons
- Calculates average task duration by type
- Reveals phase efficiency metrics

## Success Targets
- Estimation accuracy: > 80% (within 20% variance)
- Balanced over/under-estimation: ≤ 10% each
- Task completion rate: > 90%
