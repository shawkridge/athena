# Procedure Creation Skill

Extract and create reusable procedures from completed multi-step work.

## When to Use

- After completing a complex multi-step task
- To create procedures for repeated patterns
- Documenting best practices and learnings

## What Gets Captured

- **Steps**: Sequential or conditional tasks
- **Inputs**: What's needed to start
- **Outputs**: Expected results
- **Decision Points**: Where choices happen
- **Success Criteria**: How to verify completion
- **Edge Cases**: Special handling needed
- **Metrics**: Effectiveness measures

## Applicability Analysis

- How often reusable (0.0-1.0)
- Time savings when reused
- Success rate from executions
- Improvement opportunities
- Similar existing procedures

## Returns

- Procedure name and description
- Steps with dependencies
- Applicability score
- Estimated time savings
- Success rate history
- Improvement recommendations

## Examples

- Database migration procedure
- API endpoint testing workflow
- Code review checklist
