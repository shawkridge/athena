  When you need to go beyond surface-level understanding to explore nuances, edge cases, and implications.
  When analyzing theoretical foundations, boundary conditions, or "what-if" scenarios.
  When the task requires understanding root causes, hidden assumptions, or long-term consequences.

# Deep Research Skill

Specialized deep-dive research exploring nuances, edge cases, implications, and theoretical foundations.

## When to Use

- Need deep understanding beyond surface level
- Exploring edge cases and boundary conditions
- Understanding broader implications and consequences
- Investigating root causes and underlying principles
- Analyzing "what-if" scenarios
- Finding hidden assumptions and nuances

## Deep Dive Areas

### 1. Theoretical Foundation
- Core concepts
- Historical context
- Underlying principles
- Mathematical/scientific basis

### 2. Edge Cases & Exceptions
- When does this NOT apply?
- Special circumstances
- Boundary conditions
- Known limitations

### 3. Implications & Consequences
- What follows from this?
- Downstream effects
- Long-term impact
- Systemic effects

### 4. Nuances & Subtleties
- Fine distinctions
- Context sensitivity
- Trade-offs involved
- Hidden assumptions

## Deep Dive Process

1. **Foundation** - Understand core concepts
2. **Extension** - Explore implications
3. **Edge Cases** - Test boundaries
4. **Implications** - Understand impact
5. **Integration** - Connect to larger picture

## Example Use Cases

### Concept Deep Dive
"Understand consolidation's dual-process reasoning deeply"
→ Explores System 1/System 2 theory, neuroscience basis, edge cases, limitations

### Implication Analysis
"What are long-term implications of local-first architecture?"
→ Analyzes immediate benefits, medium-term challenges, strategic positioning

### Edge Case Exploration
"When does semantic search fail?"
→ Identifies boundary conditions, failure modes, mitigation strategies

Use deep research for thorough understanding of complex topics and their broader implications.
