# Load Management Skill

Optimize cognitive focus and working memory capacity using the 7±2 model.

## When to Use

- Managing multiple concurrent tasks
- Optimizing focus and attention
- Preventing cognitive overload
- Planning consolidation

## Working Memory Zones

- **Optimal** (2-4/7): Best performance
- **Caution** (5/7): Early warning
- **Near-Capacity** (6/7): Auto-consolidate
- **Overflow** (7/7): Emergency

## Management

- Tracks capacity usage
- Monitors decay rates (item fading)
- Identifies interference (conflicting items)
- Auto-consolidates at 6/7
- Suggests item archiving

## Returns

- Current capacity (N/7 items)
- Zone status
- Active items with decay rates
- Consolidation recommendations
- Estimated benefit of consolidation

## Key Insight

Managing cognitive load optimizes decision quality and prevents overwhelm.

The load-management skill activates continuously for working memory optimization.
