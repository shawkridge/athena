name: task-decomposition
description: |
  Break down complex tasks using 9 decomposition strategies (hierarchical, iterative, spike-based, parallel, sequential, deadline-driven, quality-first, collaborative, exploratory).
  Use when planning features, bug fixes, or architectural changes. Provides structured execution plan with dependencies.

# Task Decomposition Skill

Break complex tasks into manageable, executable steps.

## When to Use

- Planning features, architectural changes, or bug fixes
- Creating execution plans for complex work
- Estimating task scope and dependencies
- Choosing the right approach for the task

## Strategies

1. **Hierarchical**: Well-defined, stable requirements
2. **Iterative**: Evolving/uncertain requirements
3. **Spike-based**: Investigate unknowns first
4. **Parallel**: Independent concurrent tasks
5. **Sequential**: Linear dependency chain
6. **Deadline-driven**: Work backward from deadline
7. **Quality-first**: Maximize quality and testing
8. **Collaborative**: Optimize for team work
9. **Exploratory**: Investigate multiple approaches

## Returns

- Structured plan with steps and dependencies
- Time estimates per step (with confidence)
- Resource requirements
- Critical path and bottlenecks
- Risk assessment
- Strategy recommendation with reasoning

## Examples

- Feature: "Add OAuth2 authentication"
- Bug: "Fix database connection pooling"
- Architecture: "Refactor monolith to microservices"

The task-decomposition skill activates when planning complex work.
