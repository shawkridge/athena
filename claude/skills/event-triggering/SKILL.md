**Time-Based**:
- Cron-style scheduling
- Examples: "every Monday 9am", "daily at 5pm"

**Event-Based**:
- Actions: task-completed, goal-achieved, error-detected
- Examples: "on task-completed run /consolidate"

**File-Based**:
- Watch for file changes
- Examples: "on *.py change run /analyze-code"

## Automation Actions

- Execute slash commands
- Run procedures
- Trigger agents
- Send notifications
- Create memories/logs

## Management

- Execution history and success rates
- Failure pattern analysis
- Optimization recommendations
- Learning from patterns

## Returns

- Automation rule created
- Trigger configuration
- Execution history
- Success rate and duration
- Optimization opportunities

## Examples

- "Weekly consolidation: every Friday 5pm → /consolidate"
- "Auto-analyze: on *.py change → /analyze-code"
- "Task chaining: on task-completed → run next-step"

The event-triggering skill activates for automation setup and management.
