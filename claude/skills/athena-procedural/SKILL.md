# Athena Procedural Memory Skill

Access 101+ learned workflows and procedures. Execute tested patterns, extract new procedures, improve workflows.

## What This Skill Does

- **List Procedures**: See all learned workflows
- **Execute Procedure**: Run a learned pattern
- **Extract Procedure**: Learn from a new pattern
- **Get Workflow**: Detailed workflow information

## When to Use

- **"How do I do..."** - List matching procedures
- **"Execute this workflow"** - Run learned pattern
- **"Learn this procedure"** - Extract new workflow
- **"What's the best way to..."** - Find procedure

## Available Tools

### listProcedures(limit)
List all learned procedures.

### executeProcedure(name, params)
Execute a learned procedure.

### extractProcedure(name, steps, description)
Learn a new procedure.

## Architecture

Integrates with Athena's Layer 3 (Procedural Memory):
- 101 learned procedures with 90%+ accuracy
- Workflow execution and refinement
- Pattern extraction from successful executions
