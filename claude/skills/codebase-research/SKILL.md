# Codebase Research Skill

Specialized codebase analysis for extracting implementation insights and architecture patterns.

## When to Use

- Need to understand how features are implemented
- Searching for common design patterns in the codebase
- Analyzing architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Assessing code quality and test coverage
- Mapping component dependencies and relationships
- Finding concrete implementation examples

## Analysis Areas

### 1. Implementation Patterns
- How features are implemented
- Common design patterns used
- Best practices followed
- Code organization

### 2. Architecture Insights
- Component relationships
- Data flow patterns
- Layer interactions
- Integration points

### 3. Technical Decisions
- Technology choices
- Performance optimizations
- Trade-offs made
- Constraints addressed

### 4. Code Quality
- Test coverage
- Documentation
- Complexity assessment
- Maintainability

## Analysis Process

1. **Scope Definition** - What code to analyze
2. **Pattern Identification** - Find relevant patterns
3. **Example Extraction** - Get concrete examples
4. **Dependency Analysis** - Show relationships
5. **Assessment** - Quality and effectiveness

## Example Use Cases

### Pattern Analysis
"How is async/await used in the codebase?"
→ Searches for async patterns, extracts examples, identifies best practices

### Architecture Understanding
"How do layers interact in the memory system?"
→ Analyzes layer dependencies, data flow, integration points

### Quality Assessment
"What's the test coverage for consolidation layer?"
→ Analyzes test files, coverage metrics, quality indicators

Use codebase research for deep implementation understanding and pattern discovery.
