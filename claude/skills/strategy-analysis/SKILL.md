# Strategy Analysis Skill

Analyze task characteristics and recommend optimal strategies.

## When to Use

- Planning complex work
- Choosing between multiple approaches
- Optimizing for specific goals (speed, quality, learning)
- Analyzing task fit for available resources

## Strategies

1. Hierarchical (well-defined requirements)
2. Iterative (evolving requirements)
3. Spike-based (investigate unknowns)
4. Parallel (independent tasks)
5. Sequential (linear dependencies)
6. Deadline-driven (hard deadline focus)
7. Quality-first (quality optimization)
8. Collaborative (team work)
9. Exploratory (multiple approaches)

## Analysis

- Task complexity, timeline, team size
- Requirements clarity, dependencies
- Quality requirements and constraints
- Scoring each strategy (0.0-1.0)

## Returns

- Top recommended strategy with score
- Alternative strategies ranked
- Task characteristic analysis
- Strategy-specific tips
- Time savings estimates
- Risk mitigation guidance

The strategy-analysis skill activates when analyzing complex tasks.
