- **Source Evaluation** - Assess credibility and reliability
- **Fact Extraction** - Pull key information from sources
- **Trend Analysis** - Identify patterns in web discussions
- **Citation Management** - Track and cite sources properly

## Research Process

1. **Search Strategy** - Determine best search terms
2. **Source Evaluation** - Assess credibility (academic, commercial, community)
3. **Information Extraction** - Find relevant facts
4. **Contradiction Detection** - Note when sources disagree
5. **Synthesis** - Compile into coherent findings

## Source Quality Tiers
