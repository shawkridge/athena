# Documentation Research Skill

Specialized documentation gathering and organization for creating comprehensive reference materials.

## When to Use

- Need to compile research into usable guides
- Creating reference documentation from findings
- Organizing knowledge for future access
- Building implementation guides with examples
- Cross-linking related topics
- Documenting decisions and their rationale

## Documentation Types

### 1. Reference Guide
- Topic overview
- Key concepts explained
- How-to sections
- Common patterns
- Examples
- FAQ
- Glossary

### 2. Implementation Guide
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples
- Best practices
- Common mistakes
- Troubleshooting
- Performance tips

### 3. Architecture Document
- System overview
- Component descriptions
- Relationships
- Data flow
- Design decisions
- Trade-offs

### 4. Decision Log
- What was decided
- Why it was decided
- Alternatives considered
- Impact analysis
- When it was decided

## Documentation Process

1. **Collection** - Gather all research
2. **Organization** - Structure logically
3. **Writing** - Create clear explanations
4. **Examples** - Add concrete examples
5. **Cross-linking** - Connect related material
6. **Review** - Verify accuracy
7. **Publication** - Format for use

## Example Use Cases

### Reference Guide Creation
"Document the GraphRAG approach"
→ Gathers community detection info, organizes concepts, adds examples, creates FAQ

### Implementation Guide
"Create async/await implementation guide"
→ Compiles patterns, step-by-step instructions, code examples, troubleshooting

### Decision Documentation
"Document why we chose SQLite over PostgreSQL"
→ Records decision rationale, alternatives considered, trade-offs, context

Use documentation research to capture and organize knowledge for lasting value.
