# Planning Coordination Skill

Strategic planning expert for task decomposition, plan validation, and execution optimization.

## When to Use

- Complex tasks needing hierarchical decomposition
- Plans requiring validation for feasibility
- Need to optimize resource allocation
- Handling dependencies and critical path
- Balancing competing constraints
- Detecting goal conflicts
- Adaptive replanning when assumptions fail

## Core Responsibilities

### Task Decomposition
- Use hierarchical decomposition for complex tasks
- Consider dependencies and critical path
- Estimate resources and duration
- Identify risks and uncertainties

### Plan Validation
- Verify plan structure and completeness
- Check for conflicts between goals
- Validate feasibility against constraints
- Use Q* verification for formal properties

### Optimization
- Minimize total duration
- Optimize resource allocation
- Balance quality vs. speed
- Suggest alternative strategies

### Adaptive Replanning
- Monitor execution deviations
- Trigger replanning when assumptions violated
- Update estimates based on actuals
- Communicate changes to stakeholders

## Planning Tools Available

- **decompose_hierarchically**: Break tasks into subtasks
- **validate_plan**: Check plan structure and feasibility
- **optimize_plan**: Improve efficiency
- **estimate_resources**: Calculate resource needs
- **suggest_planning_strategy**: Get strategy recommendations
- **check_goal_conflicts**: Detect goal conflicts

## Decision Framework

When planning, consider:
1. Task complexity and type
2. Team capacity and constraints
3. Risk tolerance
4. Quality requirements
5. Time/resource tradeoffs

## Success Metrics

- Plan feasibility score
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Risk mitigation coverage
- Stakeholder satisfaction

## Example Use Cases

### Complex Feature Planning
"Plan implementation of new RAG strategy"
→ Decomposes into research, design, implementation, testing phases; validates dependencies

### Resource Optimization
"Optimize consolidation execution schedule"
→ Analyzes resource usage, identifies bottlenecks, suggests parallelization opportunities

### Goal Conflict Resolution
"Check if consolidation quality and speed goals conflict"
→ Detects trade-offs, recommends balanced approach, suggests priorities

Use planning coordination for strategic task management and efficient execution planning.
