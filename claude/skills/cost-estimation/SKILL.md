# Cost Estimation Skill

Estimate costs and optimize resource allocation across projects.

## When to Use

- Planning task budget
- Tracking actual vs. estimated costs
- Identifying cost optimization opportunities
- Resource allocation decisions
- ROI analysis

## Cost Categories

- Developer time (hours × rate)
- Cloud resources (compute, storage, bandwidth)
- Third-party APIs
- Infrastructure (servers, databases)
- Testing and QA
- Deployment costs

## Capabilities

- Cost estimation with confidence intervals
- Budget tracking and monitoring
- Anomaly detection (>20% overruns)
- Optimization suggestions with savings estimates
- Resource conflict detection
- ROI analysis

## Returns

- Total cost estimate (±confidence)
- Cost breakdown by category
- Optimization opportunities
- Historical comparison
- Time/cost tradeoffs
- Potential savings

## Examples

- "Add OAuth2 authentication": $8,500 (±$2,000)
- Optimization: Use library to save $1,500
- Cost-quality tradeoff analysis

The cost-estimation skill activates for budget-related decisions.
