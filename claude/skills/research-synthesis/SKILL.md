# Research Synthesis Skill

Expert synthesis combining multiple perspectives to create unified understanding and identify consensus.

## When to Use

- Multiple sources provide different perspectives
- Need to identify areas of agreement and disagreement
- Building consensus from diverse expert opinions
- Resolving contradictions between sources
- Creating coherent narrative from varied inputs
- Understanding mainstream vs. emerging thinking

## Synthesis Process

1. **Perspective Collection** - Gather all viewpoints
2. **Theme Identification** - Find common threads
3. **Consensus Detection** - Where do sources agree?
4. **Disagreement Analysis** - Why do they differ?
5. **Narrative Creation** - Tell coherent story

## Consensus Levels

### Strong Consensus (90%+ agreement)
- Mainstream thinking
- Well-established practice
- Include with confidence

### Moderate Consensus (70-89% agreement)
- Generally accepted
- Some variation
- Include with note of variation

### Weak Consensus (50-69% agreement)
- Contested area
- Multiple valid perspectives
- Present multiple viewpoints

### No Consensus (<50% agreement)
- Active disagreement
- Research ongoing
- Flag as uncertain

## Contradiction Analysis

When sources disagree:

1. **Identify Reason** - Why the disagreement?
   - Different contexts
   - Different values/goals
   - Different evidence
   - Evolution over time

2. **Assess Validity** - Which is more correct?
   - Evidence quality
   - Source credibility
   - Recency
   - Applicability

3. **Recommend** - Which perspective to follow?
   - For your context
   - For your goals
   - Given your constraints

## Output Format

```
Expert Synthesis
Topic: [research topic]

Consensus View:
[The mainstream/agreed-upon perspective]

Areas of Strong Agreement:
- [Point 1] - All sources agree
- [Point 2] - All sources agree

Areas of Disagreement:
- [Topic]: Perspective A [X], Perspective B [Y]
  - Reason for disagreement: [explanation]
  - Which is more valid: [assessment]

Emerging Consensus:
- [Newer thinking that's gaining traction]

Dissenting Views:
- [Valid alternative perspective]

Recommendation:
For [your context], the consensus is: [recommendation]

Supporting Evidence:
- [Evidence point 1] - [source]
- [Evidence point 2] - [source]
```

## Example Use Cases

### Technology Consensus
"What's the consensus on microservices architecture?"
→ Synthesizes industry opinions, identifies strong agreement (benefits at scale), disagreements (complexity costs)

### Best Practice Synthesis
"Synthesize expert views on async/await patterns"
→ Combines multiple sources, identifies consensus practices, notes contextual variations

### Contradiction Resolution
"Different sources say different things about consolidation frequency"
→ Analyzes why they differ (use case, scale), recommends for our context

Use research synthesis to build coherent understanding from diverse expert perspectives.
