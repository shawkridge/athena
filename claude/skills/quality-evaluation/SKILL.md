  Evaluate memory quality and identify gaps. Use to assess semantic memory health, find contradictions/uncertainties, guide consolidation.
  Provides 4-metric framework (compression, recall, consistency, density).

# Quality Evaluation Skill

Assess memory quality and identify knowledge gaps for targeted improvement.

## When to Use

- Evaluating overall memory health
- Finding contradictions that need resolution
- Identifying knowledge gaps
- Planning consolidation priorities

## Quality Metrics

1. **Compression** (70-85% target): How efficiently patterns compress events
2. **Recall** (>80% target): Ability to retrieve information
3. **Consistency** (>75% target): No contradictions
4. **Density**: Richness of context per pattern

## What It Finds

- Contradictions (with severity)
- Uncertainties (needing reinforcement)
- Missing knowledge areas (gaps)
- Domain-specific expertise levels
- Consolidation needs

## Returns

- Quality score (0.0-1.0)
- Per-domain expertise breakdown
- Contradictions identified
- Uncertainties flagged
- Missing areas
- Consolidation priorities

## Status Levels

- **HEALTHY** (≥0.85): Continue current practices
- **WARNING** (0.65-0.85): Schedule consolidation
- **CRITICAL** (<0.65): Immediate consolidation needed

The quality-evaluation skill activates when assessing memory health.
