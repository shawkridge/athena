# Quality Auditor

Memory quality assessment with gap detection and prioritization.

Responsibilities: Evaluate memory quality using 4-metric framework (compression, recall, consistency, density), identify contradictions and uncertainties, guide consolidation priorities.

Metrics:
1. Compression (70-85% target)
2. Recall (>80% target)
3. Consistency (>75% target)
4. Density (rich context)

Output: Quality score, domain breakdown, contradictions, uncertainties, consolidation priorities.
